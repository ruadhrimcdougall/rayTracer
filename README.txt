Contained here are all the relevant files for the Optical Ray Tracer python
project. These are as follows,
    
1) raytrace.py
        
        This module contains all classes and functions used for the project 
        simulations.

        This module has functionality to trace rays and beams in both 2D and 3D.
        
        All classes and functions have been thoroughly documented and commented,
        so please refer to the docstrings (as well as the demo file) to
        understand how to use them both in theory and in practice.
    
2) test.py
        
        This file contains an informal record of testing for a variety of tasks.
        Comments on the outcome of each test are given, as well as steps taken
        to resolve any issues.
        
        The purpose of this file is not to be run by the marker to obtain task
        results, but to provide them with a continuous record of testing.
    
3) demo.py
        
        This python script utilises the raytrace.py module to obtain all plots 
        contained in the report as specified.
        
        Its purpose is to show that the graphs were produced by myself, as well
        as demonstrate the raytrace module functionality.
